Ruinart, the oldest established Champagne house, was founded in 1729, and documents show it began shipping bubbly in 1764. The style gained in popularity among French and English nobility. In 1745, Mo\u00ebt & Chandon became the first purveyor to a European royal court, at the court of King Louis XV. Veuve Clicquot was then founded in 1772. Among other things, Madame Clicquot invented the riddling process to remove yeast after secondary fermentation, creating the traditional method of m\u00e9thode champenoise. Sparkling wines have been produced in the Golden State since the 1860s Visit the two best sparkling wineries in Sonoma and Napa. Have lunch in one of the restaurants on Sonoma Plaza. Visit local souvenir shops and art galleries. Enjoy scenery and architecture.",
